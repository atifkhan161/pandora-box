# Spec Rules for AI Agent

## 1. Requirements Phase
- Start every task by reviewing `tasks.md` in .kiro folder and identifying all referenced requirements (e.g., _Requirements: 9.1, 9.2_).
- For each requirement, read the relevant entry in `requirements.md` in .kiro folder.
- Ensure acceptance criteria are clear and actionable before proceeding.

## 2. Design Phase
- Once requirements are fully understood, open `design.md` in .kiro folder.
- Analyze architectural plans, diagrams, and design decisions relevant to the task.
- Document how requirements will be addressed by the design, including any dependencies or user stories.

## 3. Implementation Phase
- Follow the implementation strategy as outlined in `design.md` in .kiro folder.
- Break the implementation into discrete, accountable pieces as per the Kiro specs workflow.
- Track progress clearly with references to specs, requirements, and design artifacts.

## 4. Traceability and Collaboration
- At each step, update references and link work back to specs, requirements, and design files.
- Ensure every change is traceable and that documentation is updated as needed.
- Communicate status and changes to all stakeholders.

## 5. Best Practices
- Divide work into user stories and acceptance criteria.
- Use architecture plans, diagrams, and sequence charts wherever applicable.
- Follow a collaborative, iterative process: clarify, review, and update at each phase.
