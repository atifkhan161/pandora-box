# Requirement Document: Pandora Progressive Web Application

## Project Overview

Pandora is a mobile-first, self-hosted Progressive Web Application designed to unify media discovery, download management, file operations, container control, and media server updates on a Raspberry Pi or similar home server setup. The goal is to consolidate multiple Dockerized services into a single, responsive, installable interface using a contemporary modern dark UI.[^5][^6]

## Problem Statement

Managing multiple media tools, downloaders, file systems, and containers is complex and fragmented for home media enthusiasts and families. Pandora resolves these pain points by offering a unified solution with integrated automation, privacy, and extensibility.[^6][^5]

## Objectives \& Success Metrics

- Provide a unified PWA interface for media management
- Integrate TMDB and Watchmode APIs for enhanced discovery
- Automate torrent search and downloads with Jackett and qBittorrent
- Offer robust RESTful file operations with Cloud Commander and Samba
- Centralize Docker container control via Portainer integration
- Refresh Jellyfin media libraries automatically after file operations
- Secure backend proxying for all external APIs and tokens
- Achieve installable, touch-friendly experience with modern dark theming


## Target Users \& Stakeholders

- Home media server owners (Raspberry Pi, NAS, self-hosted)
- Families seeking privacy-optimized media management
- Power users needing Docker/container orchestration
- Developers and system administrators maintaining home media ecosystems


## User Stories

- As a media enthusiast, I want to browse trending media, search and download torrents, and keep my library up to date without switching tools.
- As a parent, I want secure access and session management for different users, including RBAC for family members.
- As a sysadmin, I want to monitor and control Docker containers, automate updates, and manage files across Samba shares in real-time.


## Features \& Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Secure authentication with JWT and role-based access
- API proxying for TMDB, Watchmode, Jackett, qBittorrent, Cloud Commander, Portainer, Jellyfin
- Real-time WebSocket updates for download status
- File operations (move, browse, history) on Samba shares via REST
- Container and stack monitoring and controls (restart, log view, health status)
- Automated Jellyfin library refresh on file operations and download completion
- Centralized configuration and token management with encrypted LokiJS backend


### Technical Requirements

- Frontend: Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS (CSS variables, `--pb-`)
- Backend: NestJS (TypeScript), LokiJS (NoSQL DB)
- Hosting: Docker containers
- All API and data flows routed via backend for security and privacy


### Non-Functional Requirements

- Privacy: Data stored locally, backend key management, HTTPS enforced
- Performance: Responsive on mobile devices, fast DB access (embedded LokiJS)
- Accessibility: Adheres to WCAG guidelines, modern dark theme palette
- Extensibility: Modular design for integration of new media sources and services


## Designs \& Theming

- Installable PWA with modern dark UI by default
- CSS theming via variables, real-time switching
- Card-based media displays, touch-friendly interactions


## Scope

**In Scope**:

- Dockerized deployments, core media workflow, REST API integration for supported services

**Out of Scope**:

- Direct media transcoding, non-self-hosted cloud integrations, deep analytics (initial release)


## Timeline \& Milestones

- MVP: Unified dashboard, download management, auth, basic container/file controls
- v1.0: Full API proxying, theme customizer, real-time updates, Jellyfin enhancements
- v1.1+: Subtitle integration, AI recommendations, WireGuard VPN support


## Dependencies

- Docker for service orchestration
- Supported APIs (TMDB, Watchmode, Jackett, etc.)
- Jellyfin and Samba servers operational on local network


## Constraints

- LokiJS database is file-based, suitable for small to medium datasets
- Initial focus on Raspberry Pi/ARM and Linux hosts


## Open Questions

- Multi-user federation and remote access policies
- Extended plugin ecosystem for new media pipelines
